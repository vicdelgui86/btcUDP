btcUDP Development Roadmap

Phase 1 – Protocol Specification

Goal: Define how btcUDP actually works in detail.
Tasks:

1) Write a formal **packet spec**: fields, sizes, data types, checksum, signature.
2) Define the **nano-ledger** structure:

  * 8-byte Blake3 hash → acts as a “mini proof”.
  * Link structure → each packet references the previous packet hash.
3) Describe the **AI-PoS retry** flow:

  * How nodes stake tokens to join the retry network.
  * How the LSTM model predicts packet loss.
  * Rules for re-transmission and rewards/slashing.
4) Write a **technical whitepaper.md** (in `/docs`) summarizing architecture.
5) Add a sequence diagram of packet flow → Stacks contract → verification.


Phase 2 – Core Implementation 

Goal: Turn the concept into code.
Tasks:

1) Expand `blockudp.js` into a real module that:

  * Encodes packets with nano-headers (`hash`, `prev`, `critical`).
  * Handles QUIC or UDP sockets.
  * Calls Stacks contracts for verification.
2) Finalize Clarity contracts:

  * `nano-ledger.clar` for packet hash chain verification.
  * `pos-retry.clar` for staking + slashing logic.
3) Write a **retry.js** module for LSTM prediction (start simple).
4) Create a **config.json** for node peers, ports, and token addresses.

Phase 3 – Testing & Simulation

Goal: Prove reliability and performance.
Tasks:

1) Build local simulator: emulate packet drops, tampering, latency.
2) Write Jest tests for Clarity contracts.
3) Benchmark throughput and latency (aim for 10K pkt/sec, 1 ms RTT).
4) Write a `tests/README.md` summarizing results.
5) Add GitHub CI to run automatic verification.


Phase 4 – Documentation & Onboarding

Goal: Make it easy for developers to understand and use.
Tasks:

1) Write `/docs/api.md` for JS functions and contract methods.
2) Create `/examples/README.md` showing how to integrate.
3) Record short screen demo (gif or mp4) showing packet flow.
4) Update main README with setup, usage, and diagrams.


Phase 5 – Incentives & Governance 

Goal: Design sustainable economics for retry nodes and security.
Tasks:

1) Write `/docs/tokenomics.md`:
  * How staking works.
  * How nodes earn fees or are slashed.
2) Add governance proposal flow to `pos-retry.clar` (optional).
3) Simulate different stake weights and failure cases.


Phase 6 – Demos & Integrations

Goal: Show btcUDP in action.
Examples:

1. Fortnite-like demo: record and verify headshot packets.
2. Zoom-like stream: fast UDP for video, retry for key frames.
3. Web3 game: require sBTC stake to join a match.
4. IoT demo: drone telemetry verified through nano-ledgers.
5. FileSync app: transfer files over btcUDP with tamper-proof proofs.

Tasks:

1) Build 2-3 working demos in `/examples/`.
2) Measure **economic impact** (token cost vs. savings, latency reduction).
3) Write summary report `/docs/demos.md`.


Final Goal 

1) Fully working **btcUDP v0.1** on Stacks testnet.
2) Public documentation site (GitHub Pages or Docusaurus).
3) Announcement + example demos.
