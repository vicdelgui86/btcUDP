Phase 4 is intended to add:
1) Cross-node consensus & conflict resolution
  - Ensure multiple nodes agree on the order of packets before anchoring.
  - Detect and resolve forks or inconsistent packet sequences.

2) Advanced network metrics & monitoring
  - Track packet propagation latency, anchor success/failure, and node health.
  - Optional dashboards or Prometheus/Grafana integration.

3)Optimized gas & cost management for anchors
  - Adaptive batch sizes depending on network load.
  - Compression or delta-merkle techniques to reduce anchor size.

4) Optional integration with multiple chains
  - Anchor roots to Bitcoin, Stacks, or EVM chains dynamically.

5) Enhanced security & trust layers
  - Node whitelisting, reputation scores, or on-chain identity binding.

Essentially, Phase 4 moves from basic batch anchoring to a fully decentralized, resilient, and optimized network where nodes can safely anchor packets even in the presence of faults or malicious peers.
